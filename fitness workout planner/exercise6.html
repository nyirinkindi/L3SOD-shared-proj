        <li><strong>Deadlifts:</strong> A compound movement that engages the entire back along with the glutes and hamstrings.</li>
        <li><strong>Bent-Over Rows:</strong> This exercise targets the middle back and helps improve posture.</li>
        <li><strong>Lat Pulldowns:</strong> A machine-based exercise that focuses on the latissimus dorsi muscles.</li>
        <li><strong>Seated Cable Rows:</strong> This exercise works the middle back and helps build thickness in the back muscles.</li>
        <li><strong>Face Pulls:</strong> An excellent exercise for targeting the rear deltoids and upper traps, promoting shoulder health.</li>
