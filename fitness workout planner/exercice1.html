    <h3>Gymnastics Exercise</h3>
    <p>Gymnastics exercises are a great way to improve flexibility, strength, and coordination. Here are some common gymnastics exercises you can try:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Handstands:</strong> Practice balancing on your hands to build upper body strength and improve balance.</li>
        <li><strong>Cartwheels:</strong> A fundamental gymnastics move that helps with coordination and agility.</li>
        <li><strong>Backbends:</strong> This exercise improves flexibility in the spine and shoulders.</li>
        <li><strong>Splits:</strong> Work on your flexibility by practicing front and side splits.</li>
        <li><strong>Round-offs:</strong> A dynamic move that combines a cartwheel with a jump, useful for tumbling routines.</li>
        <li><strong>Tumbling:</strong> Practice rolls, flips, and other acrobatic moves to enhance your overall gymnastics skills.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Remember to warm up before starting any gymnastics exercises and to practice in a safe environment. Consider working with a coach or instructor to ensure proper technique and to prevent injuries.</p>
