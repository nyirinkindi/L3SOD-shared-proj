    <h3>Half Body Exercise</h3>
    <p>Half body exercises focus on targeting either the upper or lower half of the body, allowing for a more concentrated workout. Here are some effective half body exercises you can incorporate into your routine:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Upper Body Push Exercises:</strong> These include push-ups, bench presses, and shoulder presses that target the chest, shoulders, and triceps.</li>
        <li><strong>Upper Body Pull Exercises:</strong> Exercises like pull-ups, rows, and bicep curls focus on the back and biceps.</li>
        <li><strong>Lower Body Squat Exercises:</strong> Squats, lunges, and step-ups are great for targeting the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Lower Body Hinge Exercises:</strong> Deadlifts and hip thrusts focus on the posterior chain, including the glutes, hamstrings, and lower back.</li>
        <li><strong>Core Exercises:</strong> Planks, Russian twists, and leg raises help strengthen the abdominal muscles and improve overall core stability.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When incorporating half body exercises into your routine, consider alternating between upper and lower body workouts on different days. This approach allows for adequate recovery time while ensuring a balanced and effective fitness regimen.</p>
