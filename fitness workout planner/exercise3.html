    <h3>Warm-up Exercise</h3>
    <p>Warm-up exercises are essential to prepare your body for physical activity, increase blood flow to your muscles, and reduce the risk of injury. Here are some effective warm-up exercises you can incorporate into your routine:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Jumping Jacks:</strong> A full-body warm-up that increases heart rate and loosens up the muscles.</li>
        <li><strong>Arm Circles:</strong> Rotate your arms in small and large circles to warm up the shoulder joints.</li>
        <li><strong>Leg Swings:</strong> Swing one leg forward and backward, then side to side, to loosen up the hip joints.</li>
        <li><strong>High Knees:</strong> Jog in place while lifting your knees as high as possible to engage your core and leg muscles.</li>
        <li><strong>Butt Kicks:</strong> Jog in place while kicking your heels toward your glutes to stretch the quadriceps.</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Lunges:</strong> Step forward into a lunge position, then return to standing and repeat on the other leg to warm up the lower body.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Remember to perform each warm-up exercise for about 30 seconds to 1 minute, and adjust the intensity based on your fitness level. A proper warm-up should leave you feeling slightly energized and ready for your workout.</p>
